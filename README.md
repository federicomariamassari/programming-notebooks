# Programming Notebooks

This repository, a hobby, documents my progress with various programming languages.

## C

As I delve into C, the _lingua franca_ of programming, I find that the language is really helping me understand Python—and programming in general—much better. So far, I am really enjoying C!

### C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition (King, K. N.)

This section documents my progress with the classic book "_C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition_", by K. N. King. This has been a wonderful, thorough reference for learning the language.

To compile and run a program:

```bash
gcc -Wall -W -pedantic -std=c99 -o ex_1.01 ex_1.01.c  # exercise 1.01
./ex_1.01
```
