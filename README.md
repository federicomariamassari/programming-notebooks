## C

As I delve into C, the _lingua franca_ of programming, I find that the language is really helping me understand Python—and programming in general—much better. So far, I am really enjoying C!

### C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition (King, K. N.)

My work-in-progress solutions to the exercises of the classic book "_C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition_", by K. N. King.

To run a program (e.g., 1.01):

```bash
gcc -Wall -W -pedantic -std=c99 -o 1.01 1.01.c
./1.01
```
